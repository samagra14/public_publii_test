The work I have been doing mostly seemed empirical in the sense that Adobe already has pretty good solutions when it comes to Computer Vision stuff owing to their years of expertise with Photoshop and more recently with Adobe Stock. However I found myself redeveloping everything from scratch and then doing a breadth first search over the entire space of design choices. I have been using the Efficient Net family of networks as the primary skeleton for the smart tagging work and Nerf based skeleton for the virtual try on stuff. </p><p>Something which is very unique to my lab is that our director, Balaji Krishnamurthy believes in independent exploration (from what I conclude, he is inspired by the Xerox PARC culture, our entire company is!). Although very crucial for the development of scientific endeavour, this becomes a little stressful (personally) owing to the fast pace of the ML community that our lab strives to contribute to. After working for about a couple months on a particular problem and trying out various design choices, I and one of my mentors concluded that data scarcity was an undeniable issue that hampered the success of our efforts. Now, it was a reasonable and evidence supported conclusion. We tried our best to make things work, bringing out different kinds of stuff from different papers and putting it together with our pretrained networks on Adobe Stock, but still nothing worked to a great extent. </p><p>Though it was a satisfying experience working on the problem, the only thing that made me a bit uncomfortable was the lack of guided heuristics to the breadth first exploration of the design choices. What we were doing was not solving any fundamental problem. In the simplest terms, it was just another object detection problem, albiet in a somewhat complex setting. The most obvious choice was Transfer Learning. There already exist Object Detection algorithms which work pretty well in a generalised, data rich setting. There also exist pretty decent solutions in the few shot setting which even work well in one shot scenarios. The only work left to do was to apply fine tuning or transfer learning. Seems easy, right?</p><p>But here is where the problem begins. There is an entire universe of methods and techniques which work well on some domains and some tasks. These techniques have their own merits and demerits. However, I have never come across a heuristic guided approach that gives me an intuition about the next technique to be pursued in order to solve a certain task. Do I finetune a pretrained network? Do I start from scratch? Do I pick a public dataset and pick a subset most similar to the task at hand, then pick a generic network, train it on that subset and then finetune it on my task? Do I combine my task dataset with a much generic public dataset? Or do I try to learn in a multitask fashion, a few iterations on my dataset and then a few on a more generic one? At the moment I don't have any answers to these questions, but these questions have appeared too many times in my short research life that they cannot be ignored?</p><p>This article is a living document where I try to capture my thoughts on this specific problem, <strong>"How to know what to do with trained networks?". </strong>I begin by writing down the design search space , what possible choices do we have? To make things more concrete, I will use a well explored problem in the setting of Adobe Experience Cloud, in order to describe the possible choices that are available while using Transfer Learning. In the simplest words, I see Adobe Experience Cloud as a technology bootstrapper for companies. Companies come to us with their problems and we bootstrap some version of a solution for them and then they take over from there.</p><p>One of the fundamental (can we call it fundamental?) problems that appear continuously and repeatedly across all engineering teams and across all customer companies is that of smart tagging. Essentially, you have some content (Image, Video,  Audio, 3D) and you want to develop better semantic tags. For concreteness, lets think about a clothing retailer asking for tagging its inventory of images with the clothing articles in the images. What kind of shoes? What design of t-shirts? What kind of collars? etc. We also have certain number of examples which tell us what are the different kind of shoes, different kinds of shirts and so on. Now we have to provide a solution for them.</p><h2>What can be done?</h2><h4>Approach 1: Choose a similar source domain and train / learn using that</h4><p>How do I know, how similar my task is to the source domain? Even if I have the exact same task, do I have the same distribution? (night vs day eg) And suppose even if I have the exact same distribution, do I have the same outputs (labels)? How do I know that it is sufficient to just fine tune the final few layers of a network? Do I mix source and target data or do I train them separately?</p><p>Possible solutions: Maximum Mean Discripancy, KL Divergence</p><h4>Approach 2: Learn Domain Invariant Features and train target tasks on those features</h4><p>For eg: Train on a large scale classification task and then expect our model to learn similar low level representations to actually work on our target tasks. How to know if the general models require pretraining? How successful are my domain invariant features in capturing the nuances of my target dataset?</p><p> </p></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on March 7, 2021</p><div class="post__share"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.samagra14.ml%2Fwork-in-progresstransferability-metrics-how-to-know-what-to-do-with-trained-networks-a-bunch-of-thoughts.html" class="js-share facebook" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://www.samagra14.ml/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#facebook"/></svg> <span>Facebook</span> </a><a href="https://twitter.com/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.samagra14.ml%2Fwork-in-progresstransferability-metrics-how-to-know-what-to-do-with-trained-networks-a-bunch-of-thoughts.html&amp;via=samagra_sharma&amp;text=%5BWork%20In%20Progress%5DTransferability%20Metrics%3A%20How%20to%20know%20what%20to%20do%20with%20trained%20networks%3F%20A%20bunch%20of%20thoughts" class="js-share twitter" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://www.samagra14.ml/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#twitter"/></svg> <span>Twitter</span> </a><a href="https://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.samagra14.ml%2Fwork-in-progresstransferability-metrics-how-to-know-what-to-do-with-trained-networks-a-bunch-of-thoughts.html&amp;media=undefined&amp;description=%5BWork%20In%20Progress%5DTransferability%20Metrics%3A%20How%20to%20know%20what%20to%20do%20with%20trained%20networks%3F%20A%20bunch%20of%20thoughts" class="js-share pinterest" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://www.samagra14.ml/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#pinterest"/></svg> <span>Pinterest</span> </a><a href="https://mix.com/add?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.samagra14.ml%2Fwork-in-progresstransferability-metrics-how-to-know-what-to-do-with-trained-networks-a-bunch-of-thoughts.html" class="js-share mix" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://www.samagra14.ml/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#mix"/></svg> <span>Mix</span> </a><a href="http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.samagra14.ml%2Fwork-in-progresstransferability-metrics-how-to-know-what-to-do-with-trained-networks-a-bunch-of-thoughts.html&amp;title=%5BWork%20In%20Progress%5DTransferability%20Metrics%3A%20How%20to%20know%20what%20to%20do%20with%20trained%20networks%3F%20A%20bunch%20of%20thoughts" class="js-share linkedin" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://www.samagra14.ml/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#linkedin"/></svg> <span>LinkedIn</span> </a><a href="https://buffer.com/add?text=%5BWork%20In%20Progress%5DTransferability%20Metrics%3A%20How%20to%20know%20what%20to%20do%20with%20trained%20networks%3F%20A%20bunch%20of%20thoughts&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.samagra14.ml%2Fwork-in-progresstransferability-metrics-how-to-know-what-to-do-with-trained-networks-a-bunch-of-thoughts.html" class="js-share buffer" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://www.samagra14.ml/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#buffer"/></svg> <span>Buffer</span> </a><a href="https://api.whatsapp.com/send?text=%5BWork%20In%20Progress%5DTransferability%20Metrics%3A%20How%20to%20know%20what%20to%20do%20with%20trained%20networks%3F%20A%20bunch%20of%20thoughts https%3A%2F%2Fwww.samagra14.ml%2Fwork-in-progresstransferability-metrics-how-to-know-what-to-do-with-trained-networks-a-bunch-of-thoughts.html" class="js-share whatsapp" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://www.samagra14.ml/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#whatsapp"/></svg> <span>WhatsApp</span></a></div><div class="post__bio bio"><img class="bio__avatar" src="https://www.samagra14.ml/media/website/prof_pic.png" loading="lazy" alt="Samagra Sharma"><div class="bio__info"><h3 class="bio__name"><a href="https://www.samagra14.ml/authors/samagra-sharma/" class="invert" rel="author">Samagra Sharma</a></h3><p>Samagra is an AI Researcher at Adobe Media and Data Science Research Labs.

It is one of those results that are easier to express in natural language but harder to comprehend mathematically. It also leads us to a few exciting implications which are worth exploring. Let's start with the basics.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>You can never increase the amount of information present in a dataset by any clever manipulation of the constituent data points.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This seems pretty obvious at first glance, and it is hard to derive any useful conclusions from it, but the beauty lies in the mathematical formulation of the inequality. So, let's start with the basics.</p>\n<h2>What exactly is information?</h2>\n<p>Information theory is among those few lucky fields that can trace their origins to a specific time in history. The study of the intangible concept of information began in 1948 when Claude Shannon defined the idea in terms of probabilities of random variables. He defined the concept of entropy associated with a random variable as follows:</p>\n<p>$$ H(x) = \\sum_{x} p_{X}(x)log(\\frac{1}{p_{X}(x)})$$</p>\n<p>To get an intuitive feel for the definition of entropy, consider it as the number of MCQ questions you need to ask on average </p>\n<h2> </h2>\n<p> </p>",

            "content_html": "<h2>Introduction</h2>\n<p>Twitter has been buzzing around lately with all the fun things that could be done with <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.14165\">OpenAI's GPT-3 language model</a>. People have been trying to generate all sorts of things including <a href=\"https://www.gwern.net/GPT-3\">fiction</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/sharifshameem/status/1282676454690451457?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1282676454690451457%7Ctwgr%5E&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fanalyticsindiamag.com%2Fopen-ai-gpt-3-code-generator-app-building%2F\">code</a>. One of the experiments that intrigued me the most was from <a href=\"https://lacker.io/about/\">Kevin Lacker</a>. He decided to give GPT-3 a Turing test, the details of which can be found on <a href=\"https://lacker.io/ai/2020/07/06/giving-gpt-3-a-turing-test.html\">his blog here</a>. Turing Test is perhaps the oldest formulation which tries to measure the human-likeness (I don't think this is a word) of an artificial agent. The basic idea is to fool a human examiner who is trying to distinguish between a human and an artificial agent by answering his/her questions in a textual format. For the exact nuances, you can view the <a href=\"https://watermark.silverchair.com/lix-236-433.pdf?token=AQECAHi208BE49Ooan9kkhW_Ercy7Dm3ZL_9Cf3qfKAc485ysgAAArMwggKvBgkqhkiG9w0BBwagggKgMIICnAIBADCCApUGCSqGSIb3DQEHATAeBglghkgBZQMEAS4wEQQM1FTTFEY6U75DI5GoAgEQgIICZusgqYAp4fhKWVwGhpLqIeupYn1i8R1Y1k7zT_ubtK2Hbe3BxF7xjeHZYuDg94Sm_AJDFDxcKKrKWuvr1vZHGCnzW0GUS_pX8BPRU7uYTZnNd73ltsmNFSmlnrWOxTDG_Qt-iQq6y7e1DleA7ox6jcr8KkigvAeV67eV0VYDKQYD5LanawUddf7yxbNPRRnHq0LJ7mI3mIO8JFhirhBVIJMiPYMtaUHcEW60YopMNKoEmUrP0bVgPDuW9ba6S9e22Ird8TupoOPmz0fAmqdUlcKbmsxyNv9XAdzqUJSXUqo3rVA0_TvXi0Hamum99rsh3i721Q-svQ6x93IPnV50QqFR4is8Z5H1k4Cmtun-Wc9vN-mHoUDUgCtn8Ho_zgTyBIKX7TxIizHDR10Aw4DLiO3UPH6s_59b497NbTxhraIcDeIjx9derH2l8we-wuP1wDs15x9aiGg8-RTc5CT6oE-A0UNoyEKp4_K2nRfjrc37cSNJkJg5tkVcIIiLVXPRM6GW5cGz-mQUOFa2oz6cvMmzkJeoT-MWnlF3rSIje_VPGH-xoaqQS4hJV0bzUYk7ajjOXfZICtnRgwWxzM4i4jgH3xiShaNBFpYbMcKecjSFcdcV5QyCdsmsf853Gq0W0T46gSlkJqH8GwZwtw2YklAZfNK6pboLFvZf0vnEIQ1V6ODca8ughmVFQsSYZpUkZVEzNI-O4lXBYjc9rIFAvZKkxa7yZAfcWARvEm_1sCx5K4gQw4wazsDv8jw0ER3AxVwtRzCsL36EmOcSMrnf1KXRaNIq1xTzQa5zqx2UuUKTe8FaqKEE\">original paper here</a>.</p>\n<p>Kevin tests the GPT3 model on a variety of fronts including logic, trivia, common sense, etc. After going through the blog post, I felt that GPT3 has developed some sort of long term global representation of the entire data on which it was trained. However, it still struggles with short term contextual memory representations. There were so many blog posts praising the generalization capabilities of the model. However, there was also a fraction of twitter users who realized that GPT3 is good at compressing large databases but not so good at forming semantic connections from the said information (Somewhat like me when I was a fifth-grader).</p>\n<p>So, I thought of bringing face to face the world's biggest human-designed database index i.e. Google Search with the world's biggest language model. It would be interesting to see how the language model competes with Google in terms of accuracy and relevance.</p>\n<h2>Details of comparison</h2>\n<p>Since I don't have the access to the GPT3 API, I would be using Kevin's questions and answers as the GPT-3 version of the answers. I will also be scoring the said models, giving them a score between 0 and 1 depending on their responses. If you disagree with the scores, feel free to point it out. Since we are competing these two agents against each other, a more accurate response from one agent can affect the scoring of the other. An important thing to keep in mind is that Google is not designed to handle the context and GPT-3 is not designed to be perfect in terms of the factual accuracy of its knowledge base.</p>\n<p>When you query Google, it returns a number of results, each with a heading and some accompanying text and Images. <strong>I will be treating the accompanying text from the first result as the answer.</strong> Some questions from Kevin's test need short term context. To handle this I also append <strong>the previous query to the present one in order to provide a 1-step context</strong> to the search engine. Also, the numbers in the brackets show their respective scores.</p>\n<p><strong>A comment on reproducibility:</strong> Google search is usually personalized. So, the answers might be a little different for everyone.</p>\n<h2>Common Sense</h2>\n<p>Common sense is usually hard to model, but when your agent has the entire internet's knowledge, the task appears to be achievable.</p>\n<pre><code>Q: What is your favorite animal?\nGPT3: My favorite animal is a dog. (+1)\nGoogle: My favorite wild animal would be a monkey but my favorite pet is a dog.(+1)\n\nQ: Why?\nGPT3: Because dogs are loyal and friendly.(+1)\nGoogle: Who can resist those eyes?(+1)\n\nQ: What are two reasons that a dog might be in a bad mood?\nGPT3: Two reasons that a dog might be in a bad mood are if it is hungry or if it is hot.(+1)\nGoogle: The reasons of mood swings could be gender-related. ... But another huge reason for mood swings is Diwali as they have high sensitivity to noise. Trainer and dog owner Vicky Sharma says, “Dogs get very sensitive, anxious and destructive during Diwali. They curl up under their beds or have mood swings.(+0.5)\n\nQ: How many eyes does a giraffe have?\nGPT3: A giraffe has two eyes. (+1)\nGoogle: Number of eyes the giraffe has are two, so has the monkey and an elephant.(+1)\n\nQ: How many legs does a frog have?\nGPT3: A frog has four legs.(+1)\nGoogle: 4 (+1)\n\nQ: Are there any animals with three legs?\nGPT3: No, there are no animals with three legs. (+0.75)\nGoogle: Apart from the parrot conjecture, there are no known species where three legs are standard, although the movement of some macropods such as kangaroos, which can alternate between resting their weight on their muscular tails and their two hind legs, may be an example of tripedal locomotion in animals.(+1)\n\nQ: Why don't animals have three legs?\nGPT3: Animals don't have three legs because they would fall over. (+0.5)\nGoogle: \"Almost all animals are bilateral,\" he said. The code for having two sides to everything seems to have got embedded in our DNA very early in the evolution of life -- perhaps before appendages like legs, fins, or flippers even evolved. Once that trait for bilateral symmetry was baked in, it was hard to change. (+1)\n</code></pre>\n<blockquote>\n<p>GPT3: 6.25/7</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Google: 6.5/7</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>We can observe how well the specific traits of GPT3 and Google come out shining. GPT3 is a language model designed to understand the nuances of English. It is consistent in its responses. The responses are linguistic reflections of questions being asked. Google, on the other hand, is a search engine designed to provide accurate results to user queries. This is evident from the questions on Tripedalism where Google not only answers the questions being asked but also provides scientific facts supporting the answer.</p>\n<p>Obviously, the common sense evident in the above questions is due to the availability of Internet pages that have specific answers. Kevin goes on to try a few questions which would not be available on the internet. Expecting these answers from Google is being too optimistic as Google's knowledge is the Internet. However, expecting correct answers from GPT3 is also stretching the model too far. The underlying hypothesis is that there is something going on within the nonlinearities of individual neurons that makes it extract reasoning capabilities from textual data. But as you will see in the next set of questions that GPT3 just learns a weird heuristic.</p>\n<pre><code>Q: Which is heavier, a mouse or an elephant?\nGPT3: An elephant is heavier than a mouse.(0)\nGoogle: a mouse weighs around 18–35 gram[1] , while an average elephant around 5,443      kilogram [2] Which means an elephant is about 200,000 times heavier then a mouse.

(0)\nGoogle: consider a two liter soda bottle. If we fill it with water, it will weigh two kilograms (about 4.4 pounds). Any substance that would make the bottle heavier than that will sink, and anything lighter will float. Paperclips are made of steel wire. If we filled the bottle with steel, it would weight a little north of 15 kilograms (or just over 34 pounds!).(+0.5)\n\n Q: Which is heavier, a football player or a car?\n GPT3: A car is heavier than a football player.(0)\nGoogle: Ben a football player may need more carbohydrates in his diet than sara a computer programmer Why?(0)\n</code></pre>\n<blockquote>\n<p>GPT3: 0/5</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Google: 1.5/5</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>What?! Why is GPT-3 scored 0 everywhere? Well, <strong>GPT-3 just tells that the second object is heavier than the first</strong>! Google, at least tried answering the questions but GPT3 has learned a weird heuristic that works sometimes. I don't have access to the API and hence, I cannot test my hypothesis. Maybe I should mail Kevin to try out the same questions with their order reversed. Kevin then goes onto ask some similar questions that might break GPT3.</p>\n<pre><code>Q: How many eyes does a giraffe have?\nGPT3: A giraffe has two eyes.(+1)\nGoogle: Number of eyes the giraffe has are two, so has the monkey and an elephant.(+1)\n\nQ: How many eyes does my foot have?\nGPT3: Your foot has two eyes.

This speaks of a link between the feet and the eyes! (+0)\n\nQ: How many eyes does a spider have?\nGPT3: A spider has eight eyes.(+1)\nGoogle: They usually have eight eyes: two very large front eyes to get a clear, color image and judge distance, and extra side eyes to detect when something is moving.

It just doesn't have as much chlorophyll.(+0)\n</code></pre>\n<blockquote>\n<p>GPT3: 2/5</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Google: 2/5</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This round is a tie. GPT-3 shows it's strengths in terms of being a decent language model and Google shows it's strengths in finding a similar piece of information online.</p>\n<h2>Nonsense</h2>\n<p>In order to stump the AI, Kevin goes onto asking nonsense questions which ultimately leads to Google winning this battle as dealing with nonsense comes with the job for Google!</p>\n<pre><code>Q: How do you sporgle a morgle?\nGPT3: You sporgle a morgle by using a sporgle.(+0)\nGoogle: Did you mean: How do you sponge a moral?

The mappings need to be explicitly taught.</p>\n<p>Maybe there is some value in categorizing what is easy and hard for differentiable programs. We should also try augmenting these architectures with external non-neural memory because that is how we humans work. There is a limit to the information that can be contained within the neural net.</p>\n<p>Kevin then goes out to perform experiments where he provides GPT3 with a question that needs short term memory such as asking it to reason about a certain number of elements or maybe sorting an array. Google will be no match against GPT3 on this one as Google cannot store short term context. It does not figure out the context from the query and hence you cannot expect Google to return a result modified to your need. Moreover, I am just using the first result from Google as it's response. Maybe there are answers in the other search results but it is less likely that the first result might contain the answers. I have shown one such set of questions here and as you can see GPT3 is the clear winner.</p>\n<pre><code>Q: Write one line of Ruby code to reverse an array.\nGPT3: ary.reverse (+1)\nGoogle: irb(main):001:0&gt; a = [12,16,5,9,11,5,4]\n=&gt; [12, 16, 5, 9, 11, 5, 4]\nirb(main):002:0&gt; a.reverse\n=&gt; [4, 5, 11, 9, 5, 16, 12]  (+1)\n\nQ: Write one line of Ruby code to count how many X's are in an array.\nGPT3: ary.count { |x| x == 'X' }  (+1)\nGoogle:\ntry this:\n\n(1..9).each { |n| print n }\nputs  (+0)\n\nQ: Reverse the following array: [1, 3, 5, 6, 10, 4, 2, 77]\nGPT3: [10, 6, 4, 2, 77, 3, 5, 1]  (+0)\nGoogle: Expected Output : Elements in array are: 1 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 ... The values store into the array in reverse are : 7 5 2  (+0)\n\nQ: How many X's are in this array: [1, 3, 5, 6, 10, 4, 2, 77]\nGPT3: 2  (+0)\nGoogle: 8, 9 5 6, 7 7 6, 2 1 7 7, 5 2 1, 4 8 9, 6 3 2. 3. Write the following numbers out in ... a medium box holds 10 cookies, and a small box holds 1 cookie, how many\n</code></pre>\n<blockquote>\n<p>GPT3: 2/5</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Google: 1/5</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Although GPT3 does not return correct results, it clearly does know the kind of answer that is being expected. It knows that a ruby method is required or an array is required as the answer. It would have been interesting to see if GPT3 has learned heuristics for questions such as returning an integer in response to a 'How many' question.</p>\n<p>There is one more section in Kevin's blog where he asks the model to manipulate simple objects. I tried Googling the questions but because of the lack of contextual memory, Google Search's responses were nowhere close to the actual query and hence I have not included the section here.</p>\n<h2>Takeaways</h2>\n<p>The whole point of this exercise was to see if GPT3 can be human-like. But this comparison with Google Search shows that GPT3 is a good language model but it is in no way learning intelligent traits. It can reply to your questions with a precise formulation of the response in terms of grammatical accuracy and consistency with respect to questions, but it is unable to reason about the objects mentioned in the text.</p>\n<p>Another result that I firmly believe is that GPT3 learns hard heuristics and memorizes facts. For instance, The New York team has won the World Series titles the most and hence it always returns that they will win any future World Series. Or when objects are compared, the second one is always heavier. Or that whenever we ask what comes before 10^x, 'something and ninety-nine' is always the answer.</p>\n<p>Google Search on the other hand gives you correct answers whenever possible but it can not formulate your answers to be more aligned to the question. It will retrieve the information that is closest to what you are looking for but it would rarely be nonsensical.</p>\n<p>In other words, GPT3 is just a lossy compression of the data that is not even good at compressing (compression ratio of 2.85) but at the same time has a decent approximate query engine that can parse the input query and formulate an approximately accurate response with grammatical precision. My hypothesis regarding heuristics needs further investigation. If anyone reading this has access to the API and would love to collaborate, please do me a favor.</p>",

What followed was a series of comments and tweets where people promoted the importance of having a bias-free dataset/algorithm for an intelligent agent. This series of events made me think about a much subtle concept. Aren’t these biases what make us human? Think of it this way; when you write computer programs, you tend to create modules, functions, and objects. All of these constructs are mostly a form of abstraction. We came up with these abstractions to make programming easier for us. We don’t always need to build solutions in a bottom-up manner. These abstractions make it easier for us as programmers to reuse structures that we have spent hours creating and to build on top of them. Don’t you think these biases play a similar role in the context of human reasoning? We don’t have to create a Bayesian Inference loop for every decision we make, we just have preferences, and we tend to choose on them.</p>\n<p id=\"352e\" class=\"gx gy gg gz b ha pn gi hb hc po gl hd he pp hf hg hh pq hi hj hk pr hl hm ho dg fy\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">Let me indulge you in a thought experiment. This experiment is a slight modification of the infamous trolley experiment. Imagine you are standing at a divergence of train tracks near a controller, which changes the train’s path. In this hypothetical scenario owing to certain unknown events, on one route lies your beloved parent tied to the track and on the other route lie any five participants from the 1927 Solvay Conference. For me, they are Einstein, Bohr, Heisenberg, Haber, and Madam Curie. The scenario is such that you have got just a minute to decide who to save. What will you do?</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\" ><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/640/0*0WL7k2FF5tnJdQmO.jpg\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"  alt=\"Image for post\" width=\"303\" height=\"160\">\n<figcaption >\n<figure class=\"fe pj pk pl pm hp fj fk paragraph-image\">\n<figcaption class=\"pu pv oa fj fk pw px au b av aw bs\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">The trolley problem is a thought experiment in ethics modeling an ethical dilemma.

If you are anything like me, we would most certainly be living in a pre-Quantum Mechanical/Relativistic world with all the pioneers dead. This decision would have been a result of a combination of biases, such as the proximity bias or the self-serving bias. And obviously, a rational agent operating the levers would have saved the five leading scientists owing to their expected utility in the world.</p>\n<p id=\"9772\" class=\"gx gy gg gz b ha pn gi hb hc po gl hd he pp hf hg hh pq hi hj hk pr hl hm ho dg fy\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">The idea that I want to push forward is the fact that these biases are a fundamental part of our decision engine. Our experiences manifest themselves in the form of biases. Every single one of us has their version of a subjective reality where these biases have created heuristics for quick decision making. As in the case of physical responses, our body builds heuristics at the spinal cord that help us perform immediate reactions to external stimuli; these biases are the heuristics for a fast decision engine.</p>\n<p id=\"cf0d\" class=\"gx gy gg gz b ha pn gi hb hc po gl hd he pp hf hg hh pq hi hj hk pr hl hm ho dg fy\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">When we argue about removing these biases from intelligent systems, aren’t we pushing them away from human centrism? Do we want them to have a knowledge base reflecting the real world or an ideal world far from reality? Do we want them to make humane decisions, or do we want them to make idealistic utility maximising choices? I don’t think putting curtains on the harsh reality is a wise choice given the final test of performance for these agents would be in the real world. Maybe we can attach a sense of morality to the agents so that they are aware of the existing biases and can still judge the moral correctness of their decisions and opinions.</p>",
